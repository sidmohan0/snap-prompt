Hello friends,

Are you tired of manually transcribing text from images and videos? Do you find yourself saying "I wish there was a way to just copy the prompts directly from my screen"? Well, have I got some news for you!

Introducing Snapshot Text Extractor - the Chrome extension that lets you take a snapshot of an image or video and automatically extract the text using OpenAI's powerful API. Simply click the "Take snapshot" button, select the area you want to capture, and voila! The text will be displayed in a code block, ready for you to copy and paste.

So next time you're struggling to transcribe that pesky image of handwritten notes, just remember - Snapshot Text Extractor has got your back.

Happy copying!
